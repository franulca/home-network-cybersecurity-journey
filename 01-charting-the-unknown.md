# Chapter 1 — Charting the Unknown

## Why This Chapter Matters
Before you can secure a network, you need to understand it. This chapter is about **visibility** — knowing what devices are connected, what they do, and how they connect.

## What I Did
- Listed every device in the home network.
- Created a network map showing how devices connect.
- Started drafting ideas for future state.
- Added a conditional formatting system to highlight unstable or offline devices.

## Key Questions That Came Up
- What is the current cable standard in industry?
- How to check actual speed capabilities?
- What’s the impact of future upgrades (e.g. 2.5 Gbps internet)?

## Framework Lens
This aligns with **CISSP Domain 1 (Security & Risk Management)** and **NIST ID.AM (Asset Management)**:  
_"A good leader starts with visibility — same at home, same at work."_  

## Next Steps
- Configure the new switch.
- Investigate the “crown jewel” server in the garage.
- Document disaster recovery plans.
- Review and update NAS.
- Plan for future upgrades.

> **Leadership Reflection:** Visibility is the first step to control. Before making changes, leaders must see clearly what exists and what matters.
