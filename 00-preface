# Charting the Unknown — Why I’m Sharing This Journey

## Why I’m Sharing This Journey
I’m in between roles right now, and instead of just reading about cybersecurity, I’m building **applied experience — hands‑on**.  
My goal is to strengthen my practical skills while also building a narrative I can share with others. That’s why I’m treating my own home network as a living cybersecurity lab.

This isn’t just about protecting my home. It’s about practising leadership.  
Because in security, as in life: **you can’t protect what you can’t see**.

## What This Journey Is About
Over the coming months, I’ll be documenting my process — as a series of blog posts and updates — sharing what I’m learning, how I’m applying enterprise frameworks, and how this journey shapes my thinking as a leader.

The project is both personal and professional. For me, it’s about:
- Building practical cybersecurity skills that go beyond theory.
- Creating a record of applied learning that others can learn from.
- Experimenting with leadership storytelling by linking technical practice back to leadership principles.

## The Leadership Lens
This isn’t just a technical project — it’s a **leadership exercise**.  
In both cybersecurity and leadership, clarity comes first. You can’t protect what you can’t see. You can’t lead what you don’t understand. That’s why this project starts with **visibility**: mapping the systems, understanding the assets, and uncovering the hidden complexity.

Whether it’s a home network or a large enterprise, leaders face the same challenge: they need a clear picture before making decisions. That’s what this journey is about — practising that discipline, step by step.

## What to Expect in the Series
Here’s the high-level roadmap of the journey:

1. **Inventory & Recon — Seeing the Invisible**  
   (Mapping assets, understanding the lay of the land.)

2. **Baseline Security Hygiene — Fortifying the Foundation**  
   (Ensuring everything is patched, configured securely, and ready.)

3. **Access Control & Authentication — Securing the Gates**  
   (Managing permissions, segmentation, and authentication.)

4. **Monitoring & Detection — Watching the Watchmen**  
   (Setting up visibility and alerts so nothing slips past.)

5. **Threat Modelling & Risk Analysis — Reading the Map of Danger**  
   (Identifying risks and prioritising what to protect.)

6. **Incident Response & Recovery — Navigating the Storm**  
   (Preparing playbooks, backups, and recovery plans.)

7. **Continuous Improvement — The Journey Never Ends**  
   (Reviewing, adapting, and evolving your security posture.)

Each step will be a standalone blog post (or LinkedIn article), with sketches, diagrams, practical tips, and leadership reflections.

## Who This Journey Is For
Because the journey is valuable not just for me, but for anyone curious about building real applied cybersecurity experience.

If you’re:
- A security professional thinking about practical skills.
- A leader interested in linking technical practice to leadership.
- Someone curious about home networking and security.

…this series is for you.
