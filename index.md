# Welcome to Cyber Safe Haven â€” My Home Networking Quest

A curious journey into understanding, securing, and improving my home network â€” with lessons that go beyond the home.

Securing a home network is a bit like protecting your own little kingdom â€” except the kingdom is full of teenagers, smart fridges, smart lights, and mystery devices you donâ€™t remember installing.

This is my story of turning my home into a Cyber Safe Haven â€” a fortress in the digital age.
Part exploration. Part strategy. Part adventure. Itâ€™s about curiosity, learning, and turning complexity into clarity.

Itâ€™s also about meeting the real needs of my realm:
keeping Roblox alive for teenagers, streaming 4K Cat TV without a hiccup, ensuring flawless video conferencing, and exploring the boundaries of new technology.

Whether itâ€™s defending against scams, avoiding endless YouTube rabbit holes, or preparing for a future 2.5â€¯Gbps upgrade, this is my way of practising cybersecurity â€” and practising leadership â€” in the real world.

Why This Matters

Whether defending a castle or leading a team, the path is the same:
See. Learn. Identify. Adapt.

See â€” gain visibility into your environment so nothing important is overlooked.

Learn â€” build understanding from what you discover.

Identify â€” recognise risks, assets, and opportunities before they become problems.

Adapt â€” evolve your approach to meet new challenges and changing threats.

Thatâ€™s the heart of cybersecurity. Thatâ€™s the essence of leadership. Thatâ€™s why this journey matters â€” because in cybersecurity and leadership, learning never stops.
