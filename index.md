# Welcome to Cyber Safe Haven
## My Home Networking Quest

A curious journey into understanding, securing, and improving my home network — with lessons that go beyond the home.

Securing a home network is a bit like protecting your own little kingdom — except the kingdom is full of teenagers, smart fridges, smart lights, and mystery devices you don’t remember installing.

I am capturing my story of turning my home into a Cyber Safe Haven here — it is part exploration, part strategy, part adventure. It’s about curiosity, learning, and turning complexity into clarity.

From keeping Roblox alive for teens, streaming 4K Cat TV, to seamless video conferencing and exploring new tech boundaries — this is my quest to practise cybersecurity and leadership in the real world.

## Why This Matters

**See. Learn. Identify. Adapt.**
These four steps guide both cybersecurity and leadership:

- See what’s there.

- Learn from what you find.

- Identify risks and opportunities.

- Adapt as things change.

That’s why this journey matters — because in both security and leadership, learning never stops.
